# üá∫üá¨ URA EFRIS Integration for ERPNext

This is a custom Frappe app that integrates ERPNext with the **Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) Electronic Fiscal Receipting and Invoicing System (EFRIS)**. It allows businesses in Uganda to automatically submit sales transactions, credit notes, and product information to URA, as required by the EFRIS compliance regulations.

## üéØ Purpose

Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) mandates businesses to use EFRIS for real-time invoicing and tax reporting. Manually submitting each invoice is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. This app solves that by:
- Seamlessly connecting your ERPNext system with URA's EFRIS API
- Automatically submitting **Sales Invoices**, **Credit Notes**, and **Product Registrations**
- Keeping a full audit log of all integration requests and responses
- Reducing manual effort and ensuring tax compliance

## üîÅ Integration Logic: ERPNext ‚Üî URA EFRIS

Here's how the integration works:

1. **Sales Invoice Submission**
   - When a Sales Invoice is submitted in ERPNext, the app prepares a JSON payload as per URA's EFRIS format.
   - The payload includes TIN, invoice details, tax breakdown, and item metadata.
   - The system sends this to URA's `/invoice/upload` endpoint.
   - The URA response (success or error) is saved in an **Integration Request** log.

2. **Credit Note (Return) Handling**
   - If a submitted invoice is canceled (return), a request is sent to `/invoice/return`.
   - URA acknowledges the credit note and adjusts tax records accordingly.

3. **Product (Goods/Services) Registration**
   - Items created in ERPNext can be pushed to EFRIS via a button or automatic trigger.
   - Details such as name, unit, price, and category are sent to URA's `/goods/register` or `/goods/update` endpoints.

4. **Security and Tokens**
   - EFRIS credentials (Client ID, Secret, TIN) are configured securely in the app.
   - The app manages session tokens automatically and includes them in all requests.

### Key Fields:
![Purchase Invoice Configuration](assets/Stock%20In.png)

- **Company**: Link the invoice to the specific company.

## üõ†Ô∏è Stock Adjustment

Stock adjustments are made when there is a need to issue materials or make changes to the stock levels. In ERPNext, this can be done through a **Stock Entry** with the adjustment reason specified.

![Stock Adjustment](assets/Stock%20Adjustments.png)

### Key Steps:

1. **Create a Stock Entry**: This is done under the **Stock Entry** document where you can adjust stock quantities for various items.
2. **Select the Material Issue Type**: Choose the **Material Issue** option to issue the stock out of the warehouse.
3. **Enter the Adjusted Quantity**: Specify the quantity that needs to be adjusted (either positive or negative).
4. **Stock Adjustment Reason**: Choose the reason for the stock adjustment from the list of predefined reasons.

### Stock Adjustment Reasons:

- **Expired Goods**: Adjust stock when goods reach their expiry date and are no longer usable.
- **Damaged Goods**: Use this reason when goods are damaged during handling, storage, or shipping.
- **Personal Issues**: Sometimes, stock adjustments are made due to personal reasons like misplacement, theft, or personal usage.
- **Raw Materials**: Adjustments related to raw materials that might not be usable for production.

### Important Notes:

- Ensure that the **Stock Adjustment Reason** is selected properly for accurate inventory management.
- You can also track adjustments made to stock for auditing purposes by referencing the reason behind each adjustment.
- **Material Issue** is linked to stock levels, so any changes here will directly affect your inventory.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Customer Creation

The customer creation process in ERPNext involves retrieving customer information, especially for clients who have a **Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)**. This is done by first checking the **URA (Uganda Revenue Authority)** database to verify and retrieve the relevant details before creating the customer record in the system.

![Customer Creation](assets/Customer%20Creation.png)

### Key Steps:

1. **Retrieve Taxpayer Information from URA**:
   - Before creating a new customer, the system checks the **URA** database for the provided **TIN number**. If the customer has an existing TIN registered with URA, their details (like legal name, company, and tax status) are retrieved automatically.

2. **Enter TIN Number**:
   - When creating the customer, enter the **TIN number** to retrieve data from the URA database. If the TIN is valid, the relevant customer information will be pulled from URA.

3. **Pre-populate Customer Fields**:
   - Once the TIN is validated, the customer form will be pre-populated with data retrieved from the URA database. This includes fields like:
     - **Legal Name**
     - **Company**
     - **Email Address**
     - **Phone Number**
     - **Taxpayer's TIN**
     - **Business Name**
     - **Company Address**
     - **Other required details**
   
4. **Save Customer Record**:
   - After verifying and filling in any necessary missing fields, save the customer record in ERPNext.

### Important Notes:

- **TIN Verification**: Ensure that the TIN is valid before creating a customer. This prevents the creation of invalid customer records.
- **Data Accuracy**: Make sure the data retrieved from URA is up-to-date and accurate. If there are discrepancies, manual updates might be required.
- **Customer Group**: Group customers based on certain criteria (e.g., **B2B**, **Government**, **B2C**, etc.) for easy management.
