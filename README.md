# üá∫üá¨ URA EFRIS Integration for ERPNext

This is a custom Frappe app that integrates ERPNext with the **Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) Electronic Fiscal Receipting and Invoicing System (EFRIS)**. It allows businesses in Uganda to automatically submit sales transactions, credit notes, and product information to URA, as required by the EFRIS compliance regulations.

## üéØ Purpose

Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) mandates businesses to use EFRIS for real-time invoicing and tax reporting. Manually submitting each invoice is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. This app solves that by:

- Seamlessly connecting your ERPNext system with URA's EFRIS API
- Automatically submitting **Sales Invoices**, **Credit Notes**, and **Product Registrations**
- Keeping a full audit log of all integration requests and responses
- Reducing manual effort and ensuring tax compliance

## üîÅ Integration Logic: ERPNext ‚Üî URA EFRIS

Here‚Äôs how the integration works:

1. **Sales Invoice Submission**
   - When a Sales Invoice is submitted in ERPNext, the app prepares a JSON payload as per URA's EFRIS format.
   - The payload includes TIN, invoice details, tax breakdown, and item metadata.
   - The system sends this to URA‚Äôs `/invoice/upload` endpoint.
   - The URA response (success or error) is saved in an **Integration Request** log.

2. **Credit Note (Return) Handling**
   - If a submitted invoice is canceled (return), a request is sent to `/invoice/return`.
   - URA acknowledges the credit note and adjusts tax records accordingly.

3. **Product (Goods/Services) Registration**
   - Items created in ERPNext can be pushed to EFRIS via a button or automatic trigger.
   - Details such as name, unit, price, and category are sent to URA‚Äôs `/goods/register` or `/goods/update` endpoints.
